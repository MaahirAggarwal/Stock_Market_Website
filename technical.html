        <h2>Introduction to Technical Analysis</h2>
        <p>Technical analysis is the art and science of forecasting future prices based on the examination of past price movements. It is built on key assumptions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Price Discounts Everything:</b> All relevant information is already reflected in the stock price.</li>
            <li><b>Price Movements Are Not Random:</b> Prices move in identifiable trends.</li>
            <li><b>History Tends to Repeat Itself:</b> Market psychology drives repetitive patterns over time.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Section: Candlestick Patterns -->
    <section id="candlesticks" class="technical">
        <h2>Candlestick Patterns</h2>
        <div class="pattern">
            <img src="Hammer_Pattern.png" alt="Hammer Pattern" width="300">
            <p><b>Hammer:</b> Occurs in a downtrend when bulls make a start to step into the rally. The lower shadow is at least twice the length of the body. This is a bullish reversal pattern, indicating the bottoming out of a trend</p>
        </div>
        <div class="pattern">
            <img src="Shooting_Star_Pattern.jpg" alt="Shooting Star Pattern" width="300">
            <p><b>Shooting Star:</b> A bearish reversal pattern that occurs after an uptrend, signaling rejection of higher prices. The long upper shadow shows selling pressure at higher levels.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Additional patterns like <b>Engulfing Patterns</b>, <b>Harami Patterns</b>, and <b>Doji Candles</b> provide insights into market sentiment</section>

    <!-- Section: Chart Patterns -->
    <section id="patterns" class="technical">
        <h2>Important Chart Patterns</h2>
        <p>Chart patterns provide a graphical representation of market psychology. Here are some key patterns:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Head and Shoulders:</b> A reversal pattern that occurs after an extended uptrend. The middle peak (head) is higher than the two outside peaks (shoulders)         <li><b>Double Top and Double Bottom:</b> A double top indicates a bearish reversal, while a double bottom suggests bullish reversal        <li><b>Triangles:</b> Symmetrical, ascending, and descending triangles indicate periods of consolidation before a breakout     </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Section: Indicators -->
    <section id="indicators" class="technical">
        <h2>Indicators & Oscillators</h2>
        <p>Indicators help in analyzing price action. Some key indicators are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Moving Averages:</b> Smooths price data to identify trends. The 50-day and 200-day moving averages are widely used<b>Relative Strength Index (RSI):</b> A momentum oscillator that measures overbought or oversold conditions</li>
  <b>MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):</b> A trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a securityâ€™s price.</li>
 
    </section>

    <!-- Section: Support and Resistance -->
    <section id="support-resistance" class="technical">
        <h2>Support & Resistance</h2>
        <p><b>Support:</b> A price level where demand is strong enough to stop a price from falling further.</p>
        <p><b>Resistance:</b> A price level where selling pressure is enough to stop a price from rising further</p>
        These levels are not exact points but zones where market psychology shifts. Support can turn into resistance and vice versa .</p>
