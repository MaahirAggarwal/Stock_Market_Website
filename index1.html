        <h2>What is the Stock Market?</h2>
        <p>The stock market is where buyers and sellers trade shares of publicly traded companies. It plays a crucial role in the economy, providing companies with access to capital in exchange for giving investors a slice of ownership. Understanding how the stock market operates is essential for anyone who wants to invest, as it helps you to evaluate risk, understand market cycles, and develop long-term strategies.</p>
